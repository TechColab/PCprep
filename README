Purpose:
Minimise the time it takes for PDI (pre-delivery-inspection) & preparation.
This is NOT intended to replace the scripted or imaging build process.
This is NOT intended to replace on-site tasks such as GroupPolicy, WSUS etc.
I believe the end user's first experience should NOT involve:
Having to tell the PC about your locale in 10 different dialogues.
  Watching adverts for the manufacturer's greatness while .. 
  Waiting for the PC to unpack itself before you can do anything.
  Uninstall / delete lots of unwanted pre-installed rubbish.
  Connecting an unpatched PC to the Internet.
  Repeatedly re-running Windows Update until none are left.
  Installing basic essential middleware and apps.
  Disk cleanup, defrag, full malware scan.
This does all of the above so the PC is in a fit state before delivery.
It does so with as little human intervention as possible.
The PC technicial can therefore start it & then go and do other things.
Also ensures all PCs are configured exactly the same in large deployments
