SoFar:
	2013-01-30	Phill Rogers - TechColab.co.je@gmail.com
	Check if I have been 'RunAsAdministrator'
	2013-01-31	Phill Rogers - TechColab.co.je@gmail.com
	installers are .exe not .msi
	Test 32-bit PC without dn
	Test 32-bit PC with dot-net 1.1
	Uses .Net Framework 2.0 SP2

	2013-02-01	Phill Rogers - TechColab.co.je@gmail.com
	set my own ENV so PowerShell is in the PATH if I've just installed it.
	2013-02-02	Phill Rogers - TechColab.co.je@gmail.com
	Force scripts to be in alpha-numeric order
	2013-02-03	Phill Rogers - TechColab.co.je@gmail.com
	replace ARCH BITS with x86 & x64
	changed sub-scripts to use 3 digits for easy splitting & inserting.
	2013-02-04	Phill Rogers - TechColab.co.je@gmail.com
	moved installers to Resources folder
	2013-02-05	Phill Rogers - TechColab.co.je@gmail.com

	2013-02-06	Phill Rogers - TechColab.co.je@gmail.com
	Major re-work to get reboot loop reliable.
	runas /user:SomeLocalAdminAccount c:\Users\MyUser\StartupWhat.bat
	Using Startup from Program Menu doesn't get authority.
	RunOnce in registry works ok
	Move oscli function to new PS1 which goes between CMD and all other PS1s.
	Now uses a temporary admin account which is cleaned up after.
	WU selection includes Service Pack
	Tested OK on Windows 7 Professional Sp0
	2013-02-07	Phill Rogers - TechColab.co.je@gmail.com
	Install Sp3 for 32-bit XP from CMD (as it's a pre-req)
	Moved temp account deletion into launcher with other functions.
	Much tidying

	added Dev folder for tools such as renum.sh

	Test autologon after logoff on W7 seems to need reboot but XP is ok. Always reboot for reliability.
	2013-02-10	Phill Rogers - TechColab.co.je@gmail.com
	rewrite CMD sequence for 'LocalService'
	Remove auto logon when demoting to prevent freze on final boot.

ToDo:
  Write an init tool to fetch the MS bits which are not redistributable.
	Time stamp as early as possible - where to write??
	In ps1 chek if acct already exists before trying to create it.
	test OUTDIR in W7 & re-test on XP
	test W7 install of sp1 and IE9 - a bit rough, but works.
	Time both XP & W7 from start to finish (using a proxy)
	Declare readyness for use - prime objective only.

	how necessary is PcExec to each launch? - Fix $arg1 Cleanup
	create separate 'any key to continue' function?

		clean up in case of aborted testing

Initial thoughts on monetizing / pricing:
	1) per hour at minimum wage (faster hardware & internet help) =~ £20
	2) fixed rate of £20 per use.
	3) perpetual unlimited license £3k
	4) 8GB write-protectabe USB flash drive, Useable restore DVD-DL, PDF docs.

Method:
	Cumulative - you can re-run it at any point to continue.
	Self managing - whatever it needs, it does for itself.
	Clean - Leaves the PC without any remnants of it's precense, except activity logs.
	TaskScripts: Standard, DIY, commision, community
